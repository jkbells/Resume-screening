Natural language processing (NLP) is a widely discussed and studied subject these days. NLP, one of the oldest areas of machine learning research, is used in major fields such as machine translation speech recognition and word processing. In this Repo Iâ€™ll walk you through a Machine Learning project on NLP solved and explained with the Python programming language.

Companies often receive thousands of resumes for each job posting and employ dedicated screening officers to screen qualified candidates. In this article, I will introduce you to a machine learning project on Resume Screening with Python programming language.

# What is Resume Screening ?
Hiring the right talent is a challenge for all businesses. This challenge is magnified by the high volume of applicants if the business is labour-intensive, growing, and facing high attrition rates.
An example of such a business is that IT departments are short of growing markets. In a typical service organization, professionals with a variety of technical skills and business domain expertise are hired and assigned to projects to resolve customer issues. This task of selecting the best talent among many others is known as Resume Screening.
Typically, large companies do not have enough time to open each CV, so they use machine learning algorithms for the Resume Screening task.
